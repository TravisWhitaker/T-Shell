# What is T-Shell?

  T-Shell is my first large project in C. It is a Linux Command Line Shell.
  
  (More information coming soon.)
  
# Goal
  I've been using this project as a kind of road-map to follow while I learn [C][C Programming Language].
  I do intend to (in future releases) make this a comprehensive shell, with capabilities similar to that of [Bash][Bash], [Zsh][Z Shell], and [Fish][Fish].
  
  (More information coming soon.)
  
# Things I've Learned
  - More about [C][C Programming Language]'s characteristics:
    - Using the Preprocessor.
    	- Using Header files.
    	- Using Macros
    - Managing Memory.
    - Signal Handling (Very Basic).
    - Redirection
  
  - How higher level functionality can be implemented:
    - Using unions to implement [Generic Types][Generic Programming]

  - The characteristics of a [Command Line Shell][Shell]
  - Creating new processes ([Forking][Fork])
  - How to use [Valgrind][Valgrind].
  - What [ANSI Escape Codes][ANSI Escape Codes] are and how to use some.
