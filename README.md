# What is T-Shell?

  T-Shell is my first large project in C. It is a Command Line Shell for Unix-based Operating Systems.
  
# Goal
  Currently the goal of this project is to increase my understanding of [C][C Programming Language].
  I do intend to (in future releases) make this a comprehensive shell, with capabilities similar to that of [Bash][Bash], [Zsh][Zsh], and [Fish][Fish].
  
# Things I've Learned
  - More about [C][C Programming Language]'s characteristics:
    - Using the Preprocessor.
    - Using Header files.
	- Managing Memory.
    - Signal Handling.

  - How to use [Valgrind][Valgrind].
  - Under the hood, Strings are just Arrays of Characters.
  - What [ANSI Escape Codes][ANSI Escape Codes] are.
