.SH DESCRIPTION
T-Shell is a simple Command Line Shell for Linux with support for command aliasing, redirection, and prompt customization.

There are 3 special variables that can be used in the prompt string; %D, %U, and %H, which specify the Current Directory, the Username, and the Hostname respectively.

T-Shell supports a Bash style alias syntax in the file '.tsh-alias' which is located in the users home directory. The format is as follows:
